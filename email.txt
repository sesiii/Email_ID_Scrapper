Dear Professor,

My name is Dadi Sasank Kumar, and I am a pre-final year undergraduate student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. I am writing to express my strong interest in contributing to an ongoing research project or internship under your esteemed guidance.

I have developed a robust foundation in software development through various projects, including creating a web application for student and donor management using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Flask-Python, and MySQL. Additionally, I designed a C++ Vector library and implemented k-NN search using ANN algorithms on a dataset of 10,000 vectors, along with KD-tree and RP-tree algorithms. My technical skill set includes programming languages such as Python, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I have experience with frameworks and libraries like Flask, Bootstrap, and Tkinter. I am also proficient with tools like Git, Docker, and Jupyter.

Moreover, I have significant experience with large language models (LLMs) locally and use them daily for various tasks, including natural language processing and data analysis. My background in machine learning and data analytics could be highly beneficial to your research projects.

In addition to my technical skills, I have a strong interest in finance and aspire to pursue a career in this field. I believe that my background in computer science, combined with my passion for finance, can bring a unique perspective to your research. I am eager to learn and contribute my best to your projects, particularly those that intersect with finance and technology.

I understand you may not have specific project or internship openings at this time. However, I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute in any way possible, whether through an independent project related to your ongoing research, assisting with data analysis tasks, or working on machine learning algorithms.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I have attached my resume for your reference, and I eagerly await your response and the chance to learn more about your exciting projects.

Sincerely,
--
